File Handling (Optional)
Exception Handling 
Collections framework - List, Set, Map , Queue, Stack

Java 8 - functional interface, Lambdas, Stream api 

Concurrency -?  Multithreading \


    int x; // declarations 
    int y = 20; // initialization 

## Methods 

set of block of statement which perform some specific task 

 S test(String x){
// statement 
}





## Constructor 

constructor is used to initiliaze the object 
special type of method 
which has same name as class name 
no return type and not even void 

Student - class

Student(){
   }
types of const 
1. default const 
2. parameterized constructor 



## OOP
4 pillars of OOP
1. Inheritance 
2. Polymorphism 
3. encapsulation 
4. abstractions


## Inheritance -- 


Iphone 10 - face id 
iphone 11 - face id 
iphone 15 - dyanamic island 
when a class inherit properties from one class to another

A

B 

types of inheritance 
1. single 
2. multi level inheritance 
3. multiple [not supported in java classes ] - interfaces 
4. Hierarchical 
5. Hybrid



1. Single 

2. Multi level

    // text messages , photos and videos , calls, receicve calls, Listen to music, Youtube(web surfing), Cacluator
    // social media , open pdf , ms office , temu , email check , weather , google map , torch , 

// Smartphone  -- Photo Videos ,     Music , Web surfing , Calculator, Social media, torch
// telephone  ---  make calls receive calls, ring ring 


## Encapsulation
data hiding 



## Polymorphism

many forms 

types 
1. Runtime polymorphism  [Method overriding]
2. Compile time polymorphism  [method overloading]

### 1. method overriding - 
during or when inheritance is happening, child class can  have
same method name as parent class
happens when there is a inheritance 

### 2. method overloading
same name of the methods but different parameters 
no inheritance happening 


Upcasting --- child class's object can be assigned to parent class reference.


## Abstractions 

hiding unnecessary details or 
only showing the essential information 

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

how to acheive abstraction ? 
abstract class [not 100 % ] 
interfaces  [100 % ]

1. abstract class 

cannot create object of abstract class 


## interface 

is just like a class or blueprint 

its a contract which a class has to follow who inherits from the interface 

interface X [contract ] [abstract methods ] 
    | 
Class Z [agree ] [implement those methods ]

## Exception Handling - to handle exceptions 
so that normal flow of execution of program can be maintained 

what is an exception? 
normal flow of execution of program is halted. 

            
Error - irreversible condition - stackoverflow error , OutOf Memory error 200GB 


            Throwable 
        |                 |
    EXCEPTION           ERROR
    |
Runtime exception


try, catch , finally, throw, throws 
 
throw  --> to throw an exception explicitly [we made our exception ] 
throws -->
